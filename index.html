    often require authors to publish papers in mainstream journals. But the reality
    is that influential mainstream journals with the highest responsibility of
    publishing articles on celebrity lies and maintaining the fame and fortune of
    lying celebrities have never and will never introduce significant breakthrough
    discoveries by non famous scholars that far exceed their own. Even some
    well-known mainstream academic websites often allow original authors to publish
    their articles in preprint form only after some key content of breakthrough
    paper manuscripts by non renowned scholars has been plagiarized, hypocritically
    demonstrating the fairness and justice advocated by preprint server
    controllers. Discoverers seeking truth therefore have to create self media
    journals, break through the crazy blockade and strangulation of fame and
    fortune <span class=GramE>mainstream</span>, and spread great scientific truths
    to the world with tenacious perseverance. Mathematics and Nature is one of the
    self media journals that emerged in this historical context. Readers will be
    able to read about a series of significant breakthroughs in mathematics and
    science that powerful mainstream academic groups cannot achieve in more time
    from Mathematics and Nature. Insight into the motives and outcomes of
    mainstream scholars who have been stifling and defaming major breakthrough
    discoveries, recognize the ignorance, arrogance, hypocrisy, greed, and
    immorality of mainstream scholars, and see through the ugly face hidden under
    the glamorous veil of mainstream scholars. The journal Mathematics and Nature
    plans to publish 100 major breakthrough papers, introducing unparalleled
    scientific discoveries since Newton, exposing the essence of the erroneous and
    absurd theories packaged by the magnificent Nobel Medal based on false
    mathematical calculations and fabricated observational data in experimental
    reports. For nearly 100 years, the Nobel Prize jury has been intentionally,
    unintentionally, or controlled by power, constantly awarding medals and bonuses
    to erroneous theories and false experimental reports that they do not
    understand at all. They have turned ignorant and immoral individuals into
    heroes in the scientific community, making them shining lighthouses in the
    boundless ocean of science. The actual effect is to guide scientific research
    towards lies and fraud. Mathematics and Nature, with its weak power, strives to
    promote scientific righteousness and alert future moral individuals to
    participate in the leadership work of the scientific community. People all over
    the <span class=GramE>world</span> who pursue truth unite and strive to realize
    our common great wish!</span></b><span lang=EN-US style='font-family:宋体'> </span></p>
