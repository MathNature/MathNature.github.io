    lying celebrities have never and will never introduce significant breakthrough
    discoveries by non-famous scholars that far exceed their own. Even some

    their articles in preprint form only after some key content of breakthrough
    paper manuscripts by non-renowned scholars has been plagiarized, hypocritically
    demonstrating the fairness and justice advocated by preprint server
    controllers. Discoverers seeking truth therefore have to create self-media
    journals, break through the crazy blockade and strangulation of fame and
    fortune mainstream, and spread great scientific truths to the world with
    tenacious perseverance. Mathematics and Nature is one of the self-media
    journals that emerged in this historical context. Readers will be able to read
    about a series of significant breakthroughs in mathematics and science that
    powerful mainstream academic groups cannot achieve in more time from
    Mathematics and Nature. Insight into the motives and outcomes of mainstream
    scholars who have been stifling and defaming major breakthrough discoveries,
    recognize the ignorance, arrogance, hypocrisy, greed, and immorality of
    mainstream scholars, and see through the ugly face hidden under the glamorous
    veil of mainstream scholars. The journal Mathematics and Nature plans to
    publish 100 major breakthrough papers, introducing unparalleled scientific
    discoveries since Newton, exposing the essence of the erroneous and absurd
    theories packaged by the magnificent Nobel Medal based on false mathematical
    calculations and fabricated observational data in experimental reports. For
    nearly 100 years, the Nobel Prize jury has been intentionally, unintentionally,
    or controlled by power, constantly awarding medals and bonuses to erroneous theories
    and false experimental reports that they do not understand at all. They have
    turned ignorant and immoral individuals into heroes in the scientific
    community, making them shining lighthouses in the boundless ocean of science.
    The actual effect is to guide scientific research towards lies and fraud.
    Mathematics and Nature, with its weak power, strives to promote scientific
    righteousness and alert future moral individuals to participate in the
    leadership work of the scientific community. People all over the world who

    assumption of constant speed of light is regarded as a basic principle of
    modern physics and has a great and far-reaching in&#64258;uence. However, the nature
    and scope of application of the constant speed of light hypothesis have not
    been discussed by relativity theory, which has led to readers' misunderstanding
    of relativity, especially special relativity, for more than 100 years, and has
    been deeply rooted. Here I introduce the&nbsp;<span class=SpellE>Dongfang</span>&nbsp;unitary principle, which has a wide
    application prospect in the logic&nbsp;<span class=spelle>self-consistency</span>&nbsp;test
    of mathematics, natural science and social science. Based on this, I propose
    the complete space-time transformation including the Lorentz transformation,
    clarify the de&#64257;nition of relative velocity of light and the conclusion that the
    relative velocity of light is variable, and further prove that the relative
    variable light speed is compatible with Einstein's constant speed of light. The
    speci&#64257;c conclusion is that the propagation speed of light in vacuum relative to
    the observer's inertial reference frame is always the constant c, but the
    propagation speed of light relative to any other inertial reference frame which
    has relative motion with the observer is not equal to the constant c; observing
    in all inertial frame of reference, the relative velocity of light propagating
    in the same direction in vacuum is 0, while that of light propagating in the
    opposite direction is 2c. The essence of Einstein's constant speed of light is
    that the speed of light in an isolated reference frame is constant, but the
    relative speed of light in vacuum is variable. The assumption of constant speed
    of light in an isolated frame of reference and the inference of relative
    variable light speed can be derived from each other.</span></p>

    However, relativity and quantum mechanics, as the basis of modern physics, are
    not so, and the problems of quantum mechanics are hidden deeper because the
    substantive mathematical principles of quantum mechanics have not been revealed.
    The quantum model of valence electron generation orbital penetration of alkali
    metal elements with unique stable structure is investigated. The electric field
    outside the atomic kernel is usually expressed by the Coulomb field of the
    point charge mode, and the composite electric field in atomic kernel can be
    equivalent to the electric field inside the sphere with uniform charge
    distribution or other electric fields without divergence point. The exact
    solutions of two&nbsp;<span class=spelle>Schr&ouml;dinger</span>&nbsp;equations for
    the bound state of the Coulomb field outside the atom and the binding state of
    the equivalent field inside the atom determine two different quantization
    energy formulas respectively. Here I show that the atomic kernel surface is the
    only common zero potential surface that can be selected. When the orbital
    penetration occurs, the law of conservation of energy requires that the energy
    level formulas of the two bound states must have corresponding quantum numbers
    to make them equal. The result leads to an insoluble morbid equation of quantum
    numbers, indicating that the two quantum states of the valence electron are
    incompatible. This irreconcilable contradiction shows that the quantized energy
    of quantum mechanics cannot absolutely satisfy the law of conservation of
    energy, and quantum theory violates the unitary principle. Further, I list the
    morbid equations composed of various eigenvalues of the angular momentum of
    hydrogen atom described by Bohr theory,&nbsp;<span class=spelle>Schr&ouml;dinger</span>&nbsp;and
    Klein-Gordon theory, and Dirac theory, and point out that there is an
    irreconcilable contradiction between the minimum nontrivial angular momentum
    eigenvalue determined by the angular momentum eigenvalue equation in quantum
    mechanics and the minimum nontrivial angular momentum eigenvalue of Bohr
    theory.</span></p>

    announced that the detected signal wave with monotonously increasing frequency
    is the gravitational wave radiated by the merger of spiral binaries, thus
    confirming the general relativity of basing on the assumption that the speed of
    light is constant. However, the assumption that the speed of light is constant
    has not been proved to be universally valid, and there are many ground signals
    with monotonic frequency increase, which means that the qualitative of LIGO
    signal is lack of sufficient basis. Only by finding out the precise law of the
    characteristic physical quantity of LIGO signal and comparing it with the
    precise law of the characteristic physical quantity of spiral binary
    gravitational wave, can we judge whether LIGO signal is spiral binary gravitational
    wave according to the similarity between the signal and the theoretical model.
    This decisive scientific research process has been intentionally or
    unintentionally ignored by LIGO. Here I propose a signal wave spectrum analysis
    method to clarify the real conclusions of numerical calculation and image
    analysis of GW150914 signal wave. Firstly, numerical calculation results of
    GW150914 signal wave frequency change rate obey the com quantization law which
    needs to be accurately described by integers, and there is an irreconcilable
    difference between the results and the generalized relativistic frequency
    equation of the gravitational wave. Secondly, the assignment of the frequency
    and frequency change rate of GW150914 signal wave to the generalized relativistic
    frequency equation of gravitational wave constructs a non-linear equation group
    for the mass of wave source, and the computer image solution shows that the
    equation group has no GW150914 signal wave solution. Thirdly, it is not unique
    to calculate the chirp mass of the wave source from the different frequencies
    and change rates of the numerical relativistic waveform of the GW150914 signal
    wave, and the numerical relativistic waveform of the GW150914 signal wave
    deviates too far from the original waveform actually. Other LIGO signal
    waveforms do not have obvious characteristics of gravitational frequency
    variation of spiral binary stars and lack precise data, so they cannot be used
    for numerical analysis and image solution. Therefore, LIGO signals represented
    by GW150914 signal do not support the relativistic gravitational wave frequency
    equation, and it is not credible to claim that the GW150914 signal wave is the
    gravitational wave of a spiral binary star. However, whether gravitational wave
    signals from spiral binaries that may be detected in the future follow the same
    com quantization law? Only the numerical analysis results of detailed
    observation data can give an accurate answer.</span></p>

    established the wrong physical model of uniform motion of molecules under the
    action of an equivalent constant force, and the classical equations of ideal
    gas pressure and temperature derived from this model that violates the

    supplement to the very perfect classical mechanics, but plays an irreplaceable
    role in testing whether the core mathematical program of quantum mechanics of
    the operator evolution wave equation meets the&nbsp;<span class=SpellE>unirary</span>&nbsp;principle. Then, the operator evolution
    wave equations corresponding to the angular motion law are discussed, and the
    necessity of generalized optimization of differential equations are illustrated
    by the form of ordinary differential equations. Finally, the real wave equation
    which is superior to the&nbsp;<span class=spelle>Schr&ouml;dinger</span>&nbsp;equation

    positive and negative strain reversal was 7.324218ms ahead of Hanford waveform.
    Then, the time of the positive and negative strain peaks of the main vibration
    part is corrected by using the superposition waveform, and the numerical
    results of the discrete frequency of GW150914 signal are calculated. Finally, a
    numerical analysis method using the minimum digit rational number solution of
    the characteristic Diophantine equation system was introduced to fit the
    quantized Lagrange frequency change rate and frequency jump rate of the
    GW150914 signal, providing a quantitative basis for inferring accurate
    information of the wave source.</span></p>

    claims to have detected a large number of ancient and distant binary merging
    gravitational waves. However, only the frequency of GW150914 signal increases
    significantly and monotonously, showing the expected characteristics of spiral
    double star merger, but it is highly similar to the engine operating frequency
    in the starting process of contemporary fighter. LIGO observers should know
    which is more likely. Other signal waves of LIGO have no research value due to
    lack of detailed data. Here, I further analyzed the frequency distribution and
    change law of GW150914 signal, and proved the unreliability of its spiral
    double black hole merger assertion by fitting the precise recurrence
    relationship of the frequency of GW150914 waveform with macro quantization
    significance. The specific process and conclusions are as following. Firstly,
    the characteristic equation for effectively correcting the amplitude time of
    the waveform is proposed, the specification conditions for the numerical
    analysis method of the minimum solution of the characteristic Diophantine
    equations are determined, the new correction value of the amplitude time of the
    GW150914 waveform is given, and then the quantized recurrence equation
    characterizing the frequency distribution of the signal is obtained. Then, the
    complex but clear data processing program for drawing the com quantum theory
    waveform is introduced, and the standard waveform of GW150914 waveform is
    drawn. It is pointed out that the drawing of the LIGO numerical relativistic waveform
    is opaque, and the conclusion is fuzzy and lacks due scientific analysis. Then,
    the iconic maximum frequency of the merger event of GW150914 signal wave source
    supposed to be a spiral double star is calculated, and it is confirmed that
    this characteristic frequency is missing in the GW150914 waveform. The reason
    why neither Hanford waveform nor Livingston waveform has the corresponding
    characteristic frequency band is further analyzed, which proves that the merger
    of the GW150914 spiral double black holes of LIGO is not successful,&nbsp;<span
class=GramE>It</span>&nbsp;means that the LIGO signal
    is far more likely to be the signal of the start-up of modern fighter on the
    ground than the gravitational wave of the merger of ancient and far away spiral
    binaries. Finally, an experimental proposal for detecting the gravitational
    wave of the simulated spiral double star system is proposed to effectively test
    the confidence of the laser interference gravitational wave detector.</span></p>

    However, all correctable and uncorrectable errors have not been found and

    nuclear meson theory evolved from Yukawa potential regards the observed mesons
    as its experimental test, which is&nbsp;<span class=spelle>farfetched</span>.
    It goes without saying that there are no mesons in nuclei such as deuterons.
    However, it is the lack of scientific basis to construct the wave equation by
    using the quantum mechanical operator to act on the unknown function, so as to
    piece up the exact solution of the potential function. The relevant calculation
    results do not form an inevitable causal relationship with the existence of
    mesons. Even if a celebrity patchwork theory is maintained, meson theory should
    have at least one observable quantitative inference from the perspective of
    experimental test theory. Here, the ground state energy corresponding to the
    Yukawa potential expressed by the nuclear force constant and the mass of the PI
    meson is calculated by the variational method, and then the average binding
    energy of the atomic nucleus is connected with the ground state energy
    corresponding to the Yukawa potential to calculate the average nuclear force constant.
    From this result, it is estimated that the distribution range of the average
    nuclear force constant of 118 atomic nuclei in the periodic table of elements
    is from 1.093992 to 1.413981. The results also show that the estimated value of
    nuclear force constant up to 15 is unreliable. However, the nuclear force
    constant&nbsp;<span class=spelle>cannot</span>&nbsp;be predicted by other
    methods. Calculating the average nuclear force constant by using the ground
    state energy corresponding to Yukawa potential is only a dead cycle, and the desire
    to test meson theory through experimental observation&nbsp;<span class=spelle>cannot</span>&nbsp;be
    realized. This unexpected result shows that modern physical theory has long
    fallen into an unrealistically strange circle of formal logic shrouded in the
    halo of mathematics: although the conditions and conclusions of the theory are
    far from the true description of natural phenomena, the theory can be deduced
    infinitely, and is constantly beautified and advocated as a profound revelation
    of natural laws. The reason why this paper introduces the average nuclear force
    constant mapped by the unreasonable Yukawa potential is to disclose some unique
    calculation methods that need to be applied in establishing a reasonable
    nuclear force model in the future.</span></p>

    meson theory of nuclear force originates from the fiction of Yukawa potential
    function which distorts mathematics. Its logical essence is to dismember the
    physical equation to fabricate a potential function, endow the mass factor in
    the fictional potential function with the meaning of meson mass, and then claim
    that the nucleon in the nucleus depends on the meson to exchange force, so
    there is a meson theory of nuclear force. However, there has never been a meson
    in the nucleus. It is obviously unreasonable to say that the interaction
    between nucleons is dominated by other substances that are not in the nucleus.
    Here I have reviewed Yukawa's paper on the creation of the nuclear meson theory
    in detail, and strictly pointed out that the serious distortion of the basic
    mathematical algorithm in the process of fabricating Yukawa potential function
    is irreparable, and there is no scientific logic and experimental basis to
    prove that the mass factor in Yukawa potential function is a meson.
    Specifically: 1) The Yukawa meson theory introduces a delta function without
    causality into the operator equation of relativistic momentum energy
    relationship, thus very covertly deleting the energy term, which essentially
    belongs to tearing and dismembering the operator equation corresponding to the
    relativistic momentum energy relationship, seriously distorting the basic
    mathematical algorithms and physical logic; 2) Yukawa's paper tore and
    dismembered the relativistic momentum energy operator equation to give a
    mutilated equation that meets the expectation but has no physical significance
    in practice, and then introduced the unrelated Compton wavelength to knead,
    interpreted the mass factor in the exponential factor of the exact solution of
    the defective equation as the mass of mesons that do not exist in the atomic
    nucleus, and declared that mesons are the medium of nucleon interaction, the
    nuclear meson theory thus created is anti-scientific logic; 3) The stationary
    solution of the operator equation of the momentum energy relationship of free
    particles is Bessel function, but the Yukawa meson theory deletes the energy
    operator in the operator equation of the momentum energy relationship and then
    solves the mutilated equation, which is equivalent to strongly twisting Bessel
    function into an exponential function that meets the expectation, which is a
    severe distortion of the basic mathematical algorithm; 4) The calculation
    results of the binding energy of the atomic nucleus show that the nucleus
    cannot absorb other particles such as mesons when nucleons combine into the
    atomic nucleus, while Yukawa's meson theory insists that mesons are the medium
    of interaction between nucleons, which is just the hegemonic fallacy. All these
    facts mean that the Yukawa meson theory, which is based on distorting the basic
    mathematical algorithms and fabricating potential functions, is a
    pseudo-scientific theory and must be completely terminated.</span></p>
